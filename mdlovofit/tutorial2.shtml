<center><h3><a name="content"></a>2. Step by step tutorial on how to use the package
for your simulation</h3><br></center>

MDLovoFit reads the trajectories in PDB format. Therefore, the first
step is to obtain that file. A good alternative is to use 
<a href=http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>VMD</a>. First, open your
simulation trajectory on VMD. Save equally spaced frames of your
trajectory to a PDB file, preferentially with the protein alone, or even
with a subset of the protein of your interest, as illustrated by the
figure below.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Save the coordinates only of the protein, or of the subset of the
protein you might be interested. Use the <code>stride</code>
option so that your PDB file contains about 100 frames (which is
enough for the analysis and the file created is not be very large), as
shown in the next figure. (By default, MDLovoFit will try to align C&alpha; atoms.
To chose different sets of atoms, see the -atoms or -atomsfile options at the 
<a href=./input_options.shtml>Input Options</a> section.)
<br><br>
<center><img src=./tutorial_figure4.png></center>
<br><br>
Save the PDB trajectory file, as shown in the next figure. Here, we will
call this file "trajectory.pdb". 
<br><br>
<center><img src=./tutorial_figure5.png></center>
<br><br>
Now that we have the PDB trajectory file, lets analyze the mobility of
the structure using MDLovoFit.
<br><br>
First, run MDLovoFit using the <code>-mapfrac</code> option:
<br><br>
<center> <code> mdlovofit -mapfrac trajectory.pdb > mapfrac.dat </code> </center>
<br>
This run will take a couple of minutes (it has to align all frames of
the trajectory using all possible subsets of the structure). The output file created,
<code>mapfrac.dat</code> will contain the following data: 
<br>
<code><pre><font color=darkblue>
#  FRACTION   RMSD: BEST ALIGNED          OTHER ATOMS            ALL ATOMS          dBEST/dSTEP
     0.0100          0.074948685          3.079368110          3.051201678          7.494868506
     0.0200          0.109298391          3.070029885          3.014516170          3.434970548
     ...
     0.9900          2.519596102         11.711487170          2.634494740         19.237318186

</font></pre></code>
As the column titles indicate, the RMSD of the "fraction" best aligned
atoms is in the second column. It is very small for small fractions, as
the number of atoms being aligned is small, and is equal to the RMSD of
all atoms (the standard RMSD) for a unitary fraction. Plotting the
second column of this output file as a function of the first column
will give you a plot like the one of Figure 1 of the first part of the
tutorial:                                                    
<br><br>
<center><img src=./tutorial_figure6.png></center>
<br>
This plot shows down to which RMSD each fraction of the structure can
be aligned. In this case, we were surprised by the fact that we could
align 70% of the C&alpha; atoms of the protein to less than
1&Aring; RMSD. 
<br><br>
Now that we know that at least 70% of the structure can be aligned to
less than 1&Aring; we will compute, in a new run of MDLovoFit, the
time-dependence of the RMSD of the least mobile 70% of the atoms and, at
the same time, the RMSD of the 30% most mobile atoms. This is done by
running MDLovoFit with the same trajectory file, with:
<br><br><center><code>
mdlovofit -f 0.7 -t output.pdb trajectory.pdb > rmsd70.dat
</code></center><br>
The fraction of atoms to be aligned is defined by the first parameter
(<code>-f 0.7</code>), the output file containing the trajectory aligned
with this option is defined by <code>-t output.pdb</code>, and the input
trajectory file, which we created, is the <code>trajectory.pdb</code>
file (some additional options are available, check them at the
<a href=./input_options.shtml>Input options</a> section). 
<br><br>
The MDLovoFit run above will create the <code>rmsd70.dat</code> file.
This file will be like:
<br>
<code><pre><font color=darkblue>
#     FRAME   RMSD: BEST ALIGNED          OTHER ATOMS            ALL ATOMS
          1          0.000000000          0.000000000          0.000000000
          2          0.644350237          1.485878211          0.896808629
        ...
         99          0.895928498          6.666012164          2.626953598
        100          0.842638570          5.966355234          2.379753569
# Average RMSD of least mobile atoms:      0.81601
# Average RMSD of most mobile atoms:       5.20554
# Average RMSD of all atoms:               2.1328
</font></pre></code><br>
Thus, it contains, for each frame of the trajectory, the RMSD of the 70%
best aligned atoms, the RMSD of the 30% worst aligned atoms, and the
RMSD of all atoms (computed from this alignment). Plotting the second
and third columns of this file as a function of the first, gives a
figure like figure 1C of the first part of the tutorial:
<br><br>
<center><img src=./tutorial_figure7.png></center>
<br>
The time-dependence of the RMSDs of the two substructures clearly shows that
there is a 70% subset of the protein which displays only subtle
fluctuations (less than 1&Aring;), and that all structural divergence
can be associated with the 30% more mobile atoms. 
<br><br>
The output PDB file of this MDLovoFit run, here <code>output.pdb</code>,
will contain data of the form: 
<br>
<code><pre><font color=darkblue>
ATOM   1984  O   SER 1 135       0.271  16.134 -17.056  0.00  0.56     1YS1                    
ATOM   1985  N   SER 1 136       0.216  18.308 -16.313  1.00  1.11     1YS1            
</font></pre></code><br>
At the occupancy column there will be a <code>0.00</code> or
<code>1.00</code>, which indicates whether the C&alpha; atom of that
residue was found to be within the least mobile (1.00) or not. Thus,
just open this PDB file in VMD, use the "trace" representation with the
"occupancy" color, and see all frames at once with the 
"Draw Multiple Frames", as illustrated below. 
<br><br><center>
<img src=./tutorial_figure8.png>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src=./tutorial_figure9.png>
</center><br>
This will give you the structural image of the different mobilities. In
red, the atoms with greater mobility, which were not used explicitly on
the MDLovoFit alignment. In blue, the atoms that are least mobile, and
were used in the alignment. This will correspond to the figure 2 of the
first part of the tutorial, and should look like this:
<br><br>
<center><img src=./tutorial_figure2.png></center>
<br><br>
<b> Visualizing RMSF data on the structure:</b> 
<br><br>
A script that allows the visualization of the RMSF over the structure is
also provided. With this script, and VMD, images of the fluctuations
similar to these are obtained:  
<br><br><center>
<img src=./tutorial_figure11.png>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src=./tutorial_figure10.png>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</center><br>
The figure on the left displays the RMSF of each residue, as provided by the 
<code>-rmsf</code> option of the <code>MDLovoFit</code> (see the input
options section). The figure on the right displays the RMSF of the last
frame relative to the first frame, as a color scale plotted over the
structure. This figure is obtained with a script which is distributed
with <code>MDLovoFit</code>. For using it, three steps are required:
<br><br>
1. Load the aligned trajectory (the "output.pdb" file of the example
above) loaded in VMD. Then, in the VMD console, do:
<center><br><code><font color=blue>vmd ></font>  set user_data
./output.pdb</code><br><br></center>
2. Then, run the <code>user_field.tcl</code> script, which is available
at the <code>mdlovofit/src</code> directory, using:
<center><br><code><font color=blue>vmd ></font>  source
/pathtomdlovofit/mdlovofit/bin/user_field.tcl</code><br></center>
3. Finally, go to 
<center><br><code>Graphics -> Representations -> Coloring
Method</code><br><br></center> and chose 
<center><br>
<code>Trajectory -> User -> User2</code>
<br><br></center>
This will color each residue at each frame of the trajectory with the 
color corresponding to the RMSF of that residue at that frame. You can
adjust the scale in the <code>Graphics->Colors</code> menu of
<code>VMD</code>. Choose, for example, the BGR color scale, which was
used to build the figure above.
