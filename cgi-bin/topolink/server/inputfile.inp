# Output directory for links (comment if you do not want the PDB files, that may be a lot)

# What cross-links to compute (all/reactive/observed)

#compute observed
#compute reactive
compute all

# If only inter-domain (inter-chain) links are of interested, uncomment the following line
#interchain

EXPERIMENT

# Optional parameters 

# Only consider observed links with score greater than scorecut

scorecut 0.d0

pbad  0.01 # Probability of observing a link which is NOT within linker reach

vdwrad 3.         # Radius to be used for excluded atom volume computation
print 0           # Extensive or concise printing
printnotfound yes # Print data for pairs for which links were not found
quitgood no       # Quit whenever a valid link is found (stop searching for shortest one)

kvdw  2.          # Force constant of overlap function

# Technical parameters for the optimization method

ntrial 200  # Maximum number of trials for best link search
nbest 5     # Number of times the same best link is found until satisfied
