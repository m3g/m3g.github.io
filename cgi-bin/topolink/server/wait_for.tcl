#!/usr/bin/tclsh
#
# This script iterativelly checks if some process
# of some user is running. It continues to run until
# the process is not found anymore, in which case
# it quits. The checking is performed at each 30 s.
#
# It is used to wait for a process to finish to
# start a new one automatically.
#
# Run with:  wait_for.tcl user_name process_name [number_of_processes]
#
# Where user_name is the name of the owner of the process
# and the process_name is the process name, or PID, or
# anything that identifies univocally the process 
# of interest. number_of_processes is the maximum number
# of processes of that type allowed. That is, if the scripts
# finds at least number_of_processes processes running, then
# it will continue waiting. 
#
# Example:
#
# wait_for.tcl leandro namd2 4
#
# The script will run while there are at least 4 processes
# of user "leandro" that match "namd2". If one of the 4 processes
# finishes, the script exits.
