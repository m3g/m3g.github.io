<p class=section>Sequential internal distance initial point</p>

This option will start the alignment from an alignment performed from
pseudo-structures built from the internal distances of the two
structures provided 
<a target=newpage href=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/306>[ref]</a>. 
Since the internal distance matrix provides the
whole structural information, this approximation is, many times, enough
to provide an initial point very close to the optimal alignment,
particularly for sequential bijective structures, as proteins. For
non-sequential alignments, this approximation may not be useful, but you
will not loose anything by leaving it checked, unless your structures
are very, very large (tenths of thousands of atoms), in which case the
the program will take a little bit longer to finish.
