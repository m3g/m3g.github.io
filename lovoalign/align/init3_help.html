Obtaining the optimal alignment of two structures can be very hard,
particularly for general alignment were no sequentiality is considered.
Therefore, it is a good strategy to use many different initial
approximations from which the iterative alignment algorithm is applied. 

Random initial points are not as intelligent as, for instance, the
internal pseudo-protein sequential alignment, but it is easy to use as
many as one wishes. Particularly for non-sequential alignment using
multiple random initial points can result in a much better final
solution.  

The number of random initial points can be increases up to 100 for the
on-line server, and arbitrarily if you download the package and run it
locally. The time required for the total final result to come up will
be approximately proportional to the number of initial points.
