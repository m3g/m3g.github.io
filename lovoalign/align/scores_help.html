<p class=section>The SCORE of a structural alignment</p>

The quality of the alignment between two structures is evaluated by
measures that are usually called <i>scores</i>. Scores must take into
account two properties of a structural alignment: 1) The number of atoms
in the correspondence and, 2) the quality of the superposition between
corresponding atoms.    
<br><br>

For example, the frequently used Root-Mean-Square-Deviation (RMSD), is
<i>not</i> a valid score by itself: two proteins may share a
very similar core, but differ in a mobile loop or hinge. The
superposition of the mobile loop and hinge will result in a large value
for the RMSD between the two structures, and we will not be able to
recognize the similarity of the cores.
<br><br>

Because of this, several scores have been proposed that are able, using
a single value, indicate the quality of the alignment. In LovoAlign we
have implemented three of them, which we believe are the most relevant.
Each has its particular properties that may be of interest in specific
cases:
<br><br>

<b>1 - TM-Score</b><br><br>
The TM-Score was proposed by Zhang and Skolnick 
<a target=newpage
href=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/109674933/abstract>[ref]</a>.
This score was weighted according the size of the structures being
compared and by the study of the quality of general alignments, in such
a way that it varies between 0 and 1, from a bad to a good
superposition. It was shown that scores below 0.17 indicate that the
superposition is not better than the superposition of two random
structures. Because of the quality of this score as an absolute measure
of the quality of protein alignments, it is recommended as the default choice
for the comparison of two protein structures.  
<br><br>

<b>2 - Structal score</b><br><br>
The Structal score was proposed by Levitt and co-workers
<a target=newpage href=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0960-9822(93)90255-M>[ref]</a>.
It has a similar structure than the TM-Score, but it is parametrized as:
<center><img src=structal_score.gif></center>
where the sum is performed over all corresponding atoms, <i>d</i> is the
distance between corresponding atoms, and <i>n<sub>g</sub></i> is the
number of gaps. The TM-Score has a similar structure but different
parametrization, and does not penalize gaps by default. Therefore, the
use of the Structal score may be interesting when one wants to avoid
gaps in the sequence alignment, and particularly it is possible, in
LovoAlign, to control the gap penalty (this can also be done for the other
scores). The disadvantage of Structal relative to TM-Score is that its
value is dependent on the size of the proteins being compared, in such a
way that one cannot use it to compare the quality of the alignments of
different structures. It can be
useful and provide meaningful results for pairwise alignments.
<br><br>

<b>3 - Triangular score</b><br><br> 
The Triangular score is very simple.  It is maximal when the position of
corresponding atoms coincide, and decreases linearly to zero for a
distance defined by the user (the default value in LovoAlign being 3.0
Angstroms). This score, therefore, can be used for the identification of
common cores in protein structures, as it will totally neglect the
substructures that are poorly aligned. Furthermore, by using this score
one is able to personally and intuitively determine what one considers
as a good alignment. For instance, one can state that only atoms which
are closer than 2 Angstroms should be considered. The optimization of
this score will find the best superposition of the structures that
maximizes the number of atoms that can be aligned within that tolerance.
It can be demonstrated, furthermore 
<a target=newpage href=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/306>[ref]</a>, 
that the RMSD found for these atoms is the best one for the given
correspondence, in such a way that the RMSD obtained using this score,
for the corresponding atoms, is meaningful.  For the other score, one
could similarly compute the RMSD of the atoms which are within a desired
tolerance, but the alignment of these atoms would not be the perfect
one, and could be improved by an additional rigid-body alignment. The
optimization of the Triangular score automatically satisfies this
requirement. Furthermore, the Triangular score for non-bijective
alignments can be computed very rapidly 
<a target=newpage href=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/306>[ref]</a>,
and this can be important for database comparisons.
