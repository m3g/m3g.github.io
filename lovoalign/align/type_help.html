<p class=section>Sequential and Non-Sequential alignments</p>

LovoAlign is able to perform alignments for which one expects that the
correspondence between atoms is sequential or not. 

<br><br> 
Sequential correspondences correspond to most Protein alignments, since
one expects that if two residues are consecutive in one structure, they
should be consecutive in the other structure. The <i>bijection</i> of a
sequential alignment can be represented by the sequence-alignment, as in
this case: 

<table align=center>
<tr><td><tt>144&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt></td>
<td><tt>GSHMEEMIRSLQQRPEPT---WDLIHIAT</tt></td>
<td><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;193</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>202&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt></td>
<td><tt>EE--LQ--KSIGHKPEPTDEEWELIKTVT</tt></td>
<td><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;247</tt></td></tr>
</table>

<br><br>

Non-sequential alignments are interesting when one do not expect such
kind of regularity. For example, if the alignment of two <i>ligands</i>
is considered, there is no rule on how the atoms of the ligands should
be written or ordered in the structure files. Therefore, one should not
expect that ATOM&nbsp;1 from the first ligand correspond to ATOM&nbsp;1
from the second ligand, nor any kind of sequentiality between the
correspondence between the atoms. For cases like these, one should
perform a non-sequential alignment. Non-sequential alignments are
generally harder than sequential ones, so if one suspects that some
sequentiality should be present, it is worth trying the sequential
alternative always.
