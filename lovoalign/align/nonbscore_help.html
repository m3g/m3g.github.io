<p class=section>The Non-Bijective Triangular score</p>

The Non-Bijective triangular score is a variation of the Triangular
score. Actually its formulation is the same, but when using
non-bijective formulation, the correspondence does not need to be
sequential, neither monotone, neither bijective, that is, different
atoms from one structure can be associated with the same atom of the
second structure.
<br><br>
The non-bijective formulation must be used for general alignments for
which one does not expect sequentiality, as for alignments of ligands,
or of parts of proteins including the side chains. Actually the
non-bijective algorithm is very versatile in such a way that one could
align any kind of structure.  
<br><br>
A important side-effect of the use of the non-bijective approach is the
speed by which the correspondence, and thus the alignment, can be
computed. For instance, since for each atom one must identify only the
nearest atom of the other structure, an algorithm was devised that has
a cost, in practice, linearly dependent on the size of the
<i>smallest</i> of the two structures being compared 
<a target=newpage href=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/306>[ref]</a>. 
This can be very
significant for database comparisons or for difficult alignment
requiring many initial points.
